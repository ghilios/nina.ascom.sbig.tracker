This ASCOM driver is used to access built-in tracker cameras on Legacy SBIG devices connected to NINA using its native driver.

To use this, make sure you:
 1) Connect the legacy SBIG camera using the native NINA driver
 2) Double check that you aren't using an ASCOM driver in NINA, such as the excellent ASCOM.HomeMade.SBIG
 3) Enable the ASCOM server on the camera Equipment page in NINA
 4) Ensure the pipe name from the NINA camera Equipment page matches this ASCOM driver's properties
